**** ISA Spectrometer and Single Channel Acquisition LabView Drivers - Readme.TXT -  July 10, 1998  ****

This set of LabView Drivers can be used to control any ISA spectrometer that communicates with a computer using the ISA Command Set.  This includes the Spex M-Series, Spex/JY Retro Boxes, Triax Series Spectrometers, DataScan/DataLink, SpectrAcq, and SpectrAcq2 systems.  The Drivers need to be configured for your individual spectrometer system.  This is done in the SPECTROMETER SETUP.GBL.  Please see the manual for more information about these settings.  Spectrometer Settings can be found in the Spectrometer Control Manual.

If you are using these drivers with RS-232 communications, please note that Serial Port 0 refers to COM1 on your computer and Serial Port 1 refers to COM2.
